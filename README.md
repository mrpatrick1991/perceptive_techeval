 Technical evaluation for the machine learning researcher role at Perceptive Space.

## Objectives

1) Predict the CHAMP measured neutral density for the time period October 28-31, 2003 on the grid:
   * Latitude = -90:90:10 degrees
   * Longitude = -180:180:10 degress
   * Altitude = [350, 450, 550, 650] km
   * Time: 1 hour intervals
2) Identify a sampling and binning scheme for the input data for the prediction task.
3) Handle data cleaning and pre-processing. 
4) Create contour plots of the predicted density:
   * Across latitude and longitude.
   * Across local solar time (LST) and latitude.
5) Identify and describe structure observed in the predicted density data and propose an explanation.

Optionally include other data sources and attempt to improve model accuracy for geomagnetic storms.
